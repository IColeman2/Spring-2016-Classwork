TODO:
-Comment shit
-Consider changing the nature of the Email Address class in Person

ONCE ALL THIS IS DONE, REMAKE THE ZIP AND JAR FILES AND UPLOAD THEM TO WEBGRADER

DONE:
-Find out why persons.JSON is straight fucked
-persons.XML is also straight fucked
-Create two customer subclasses, governmentCustomer and companyCustomer
-remove the "government" boolean
-figure out why customers.JSON doesn't include E-mails
-Make products.XML print the person file for consultants
-make perons.JSON print the person file for the consultants
-ask Nisha why customers.XML and customers.JSON prints the customer code randomly at the top
-consider making changes to make our products.JSON formatted more like theirs (probably not necessary)
-products.XML is also randomly printing the customer code in front of everything else
-So is products.JSON
