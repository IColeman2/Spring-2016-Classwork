In all the universe, the only power beyond the mind's comprehension is the power to comprehend the power of the mind. If anyone of us could unlock this terrible power, would we use it to explore the mysteries of the infinite? Or would we use it to destroy? It's a familiar tale. A power-mad space gorilla pitted against a canine detective and a sociopathic bunny with psychic powers. But, my friends, this story's different. In this story, YOU are in control. There will soon come a time when YOU will be called upon to lead Sam & Max to defeat the forces of evil. No longer can you blindly mash buttons to unleash a torrent of irrelevant banter and comic mischief. Now YOU are all that stands in the way of the total annihilation of the planet earth.
